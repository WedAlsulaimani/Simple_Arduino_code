# Simple_Arduino_code  
This little project is all about making three colorful LEDs (red, yellow, and green) blink quickly one after another using an Arduino board. It’s simple, fun, and a great way to get hands-on with basic electronics.

## What This Project Does

The Arduino code lights up:
-  Red LED on pin 13  
-  Yellow LED on pin 12  
-  Green LED on pin 11

Each one blinks for just **0.1 second**, creating a quick blinking pattern that keeps looping — like a mini light show

## What I Used

- Arduino UNO
- 3 LEDs (red, yellow, green)
- 3 resistors (220Ω or 330Ω)
- Breadboard + jumper wires
- Arduino IDE
- **Tinkercad Circuits** (for testing the setup before building it)

I built and tested everything on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) first — it’s super beginner-friendly and helped me see how things would work before wiring anything.

## How to Connect It

| LED       | Arduino Pin |
|-----------|-------------|
| Red       | 13          |
| Yellow    | 12          |
| Green     | 11          |

Make sure each LED has a resistor and connects to GND on the other side

## How to Try It Yourself

1. Open the code in the Arduino IDE
2. Plug your LEDs into the right pins
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board and watch
